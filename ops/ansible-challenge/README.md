# ANSIBLE TEST

## PURPOSE

The purpose of this test is to deploy a Wordpress site. This software has been chosen since its install is simple. The application must work after the process (no install steps to do manually).

## TIME TO COMPLETE

This test is designed to be done in 2 to 3 hours but you will have a few days to complete it.

## HOW TO SUBMIT THIS TEST PROPOSAL

Fork this repository in your own Github account and provide us with the URL.

## DESCRIPTION

The application will go on a virtual machine and the database on another virtual machine.

Everything must be automated. Ideally, in just one script you will:

* Create the VMs
* Provision them (webserver, database...) - with Ansible
* Deploy Wordpress - with Ansible
* Install Wordpress - with Ansible

Software:
* VirtualBox for the VMs (or any other Virtualization software you are comfortable with)
* Distribution: Debian/Ubuntu (alternatively you can use Redhat-based distrib)
* Webserver: apache or nginx
* Database: MySQL

Notes:

* COMMENT your code ! It must be easy for a reviewer to understand what you did.
* Even if this project is small, use all the software best practices. Consider this project as a base which may grow.
* If, for any reason, you do not comply with some of the constraints, this will not be eliminatory. We will assess your adaptation skills. Explain why you cannot or wonâ€™t do some things.
* You are welcome to use any existing module that already exists. Do not reinvent the wheel.
